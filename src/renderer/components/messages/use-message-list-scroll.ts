// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The follow engine.
//
// Scroll events carry no provenance — the browser does not say whether a
// scroll came from the user, from our own write, or from a layout clamp. The
// engine never guesses from position deltas alone. Instead:
//
//   - ESCAPE is input-primary: an upward wheel that reaches this scroller, an
//     upward scroll key, or a drag disengages following the moment the input
//     arrives — before any scroll event, so a concurrent follow write can
//     never swallow it.
//   - The BACKSTOP for inputs with no distinct event (a dragged scrollbar,
//     touch momentum) classifies a scroll event as the user's only when the
//     geometry was stable AND some input recently touched the scroller: our
//     own writes always update the baseline in the same statement, a browser
//     clamp normally fires in a frame where scrollHeight or clientHeight
//     changed, and WebKit's async scrolling can roll a write back with no
//     input at all — upward + stable + fresh input is the reader leaving;
//     upward + stable + no input is the engine, and following converges back.
//     WebKit can also move the viewport off one of OUR OWN DOM commits with
//     the geometry already back in place by the time the event fires; that
//     one is caught and undone at the commit itself, before it paints (see
//     the MutationObserver below).
//   - FOLLOWING is convergent: while engaged, every content or viewport
//     resize re-pins the live edge with a single instant write. A missed or
//     misread event can cost one frame, never a dead latch.
//   - Programmatic motion is minimal: instant writes everywhere, and one
//     owned glide (an exponential chase, cancelled by any user input) for the
//     explicit trips — send and the scroll-to-bottom affordance.

// The backstop additionally requires some input to have touched the scroller
// this recently before it releases following. WebKit's async scrolling can
// roll a programmatic write back to its last composited position and report
// that as a genuine upward, size-stable scroll event — with no input
// anywhere near it (and a landing on the recently-held trail below), that
// shape is the engine's, not the reader's, and following converges back

// (reproduced by thinking-collapse-reading-line.spec.ts 'hands off marathon'
// — deterministic zero-input snaps to the same never-written value). So an
// evidence-less upward move reads as a rollback when it lands on a recorded
// position OR inside a small segment between two consecutive ones — the
// creep path the viewport actually traversed. Landing outside that path with
// no input behind it is a programmatic jump (scrollTo from app code, an
// extension, tests) and releases following like any other escape. Segments
// wider than the cap are real discontinuities (the initial pin, an escape
// jump) — the viewport never held their interior, so they don't absorb.
// Retention must outlast the snapshots WebKit actually reverts to: on loaded
// CI runners the compositor has been recorded rolling back to a layout 2.3s
// stale (landing on creep traversed 2276ms earlier — past a 2000ms trail by
// a fraction, releasing follow with zero input). Keep several seconds of
// margin over that measured age.

// zero-input snaps landing past the trail's oldest entry). While the engine
// is the one moving the viewport (a live glide, or any programmatic write
// this recently), an evidence-less upward stable landing is its own motion
// coming back, wherever it lands. Programmatic jumps from outside the engine
// (find-in-page, extensions, tests) are only distinguishable when the engine
// is quiet — which is when they actually happen. Two guards keep an outside
// jump from being eaten by coincidence (a mount-settle pin racing a test's
// scrollTo(0) by ~90ms was real): the window is short, and the write-window
// path only accepts reverts of plausible size — a rollback undoes recently
// composited creep (tens to hundreds of px), while outside jumps travel the
// transcript. A live glide is exempt from the cap: WebKit has been seen
// reverting a multi-thousand-px chase mid-flight. The window itself must
// cover the quiet gap between a chase's last settle write and the rollback:
// recorded at 167ms on loaded CI runners (past a 150ms window by two frames,
